    ðŸŽ¯ THE UNIVERSAL TOOL - Use this for ANY task you want to accomplish! 
    Instead of figuring out which specific tool to use, just tell me what you want to do 
    in plain English and I'll automatically find the perfect tool, extract the right parameters, 
    and execute it for you. I have access to ALL available tools (file operations, network requests, 
    system commands, APIs, etc.) and can intelligently route your request to the best one. 
    
    # ðŸš€ SMART SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION: For multi-step tasks, I'll identify the FIRST step, 
    # execute it, and then suggest the next logical step with recommended inputs. This gives you 
    # control over each step while providing intelligent guidance for complex workflows.
    
    This is your go-to tool when you're not sure which specific tool to use or want to save time.

          Your request or what you want to accomplish. Be as specific as possible.
          Examples: 'read a file called config.yaml', 'search for files containing error', 
          'make an HTTP POST request to the API'

          Minimum confidence score (0.0-1.0) for tool selection (optional, default: 0.7).
          Lower values are more permissive, higher values are more strict.

          Enable smart sequential execution for multi-step tasks (default: true).
          When enabled, complex requests are decomposed into sequential steps,
          executing only the first step and suggesting the next with recommended inputs.
