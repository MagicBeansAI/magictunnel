# README Migration Notice

## What Changed

The MagicTunnel README has been dramatically simplified based on community feedback:

- **Before**: 3,480 lines (too overwhelming)
- **After**: 98 lines (focused on core value)

## Why This Change

Feedback received:
1. "The giant readme makes me think this is a spam project. Who is going to read it, no human"
2. "Looks like a giant unmaintanable mess"

## Where Did Everything Go?

All the detailed content has been moved to organized documentation:

- [📖 Complete Guide](../docs/guide.md) - All the previous README content
- [🚀 Quick Start](../docs/quickstart.md) - Get running in 5 minutes  
- [🔧 Configuration](../docs/config.md) - Configuration options
- [🛠️ Adding Tools](../docs/tools.md) - Tool development guide
- [🏗️ Architecture](../docs/architecture.md) - Technical deep dive

## Goal

Make MagicTunnel approachable with a clear value proposition:

**"One smart MCP tool that discovers the right tool for any request"**

The new README follows the pattern of successful open-source projects like ripgrep, exa, and bat - clear, focused, and immediately actionable.

## Backup

The original README is preserved as `README-BACKUP.md` if you need to reference the full content.
