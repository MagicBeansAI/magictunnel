## üî• Current High Priority Tasks

### 1. OpenAPI Capability Generation Completion ‚ö†Ô∏è **IN PROGRESS**
**Status**: Partially complete - needs final implementation

**Remaining Work**:
- [ ] Complete OpenAPI 3.x specification parser
- [ ] Implement comprehensive schema-to-MCP mapping
- [ ] Add support for OpenAPI authentication schemes
- [ ] Integrate with unified CLI generator
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage

**Impact**: Complete API-to-tool generation pipeline for all major API formats

### 2. LLM Services Backend API Completion üö® **CRITICAL - BLOCKING**
**Status**: Missing generation APIs for prompts and resources - blocks UI development

**Critical Missing Endpoints**:
- [ ] **Prompt Generation APIs** (`src/web/dashboard.rs`)
  - [ ] `POST /dashboard/api/prompts/service/tools/{tool_name}/generate` - Generate prompts with LLM
  - [ ] `GET /dashboard/api/prompts/service/health` - Prompt generation service health
  - [ ] `POST /dashboard/api/prompts/service/batch/generate` - Batch prompt generation
- [ ] **Resource Generation APIs** (`src/web/dashboard.rs`)
  - [ ] `POST /dashboard/api/resources/service/tools/{tool_name}/generate` - Generate resources with LLM
  - [ ] `GET /dashboard/api/resources/service/health` - Resource generation service health

**Implementation Required**:
- [ ] Add the 6 missing generation API endpoints to `src/web/dashboard.rs`
- [ ] Create handlers that call the LLM services for prompt/resource generation
- [ ] Add service health checks for prompt and resource generation
- [ ] Implement batch processing capabilities
- [ ] Add external MCP server content protection (similar to sampling/elicitation)

**Impact**: **BLOCKING** - Frontend LLM services UI cannot be implemented until these APIs exist

- [ ] Fix AlertsPanel component accessibility issues
- [ ] Add ARIA labels and roles throughout dashboard
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation support

### 5. Enhanced Versioning System üìã **NEW - MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Status**: Currently has basic versioning, needs comprehensive version management

**Objective**: Implement robust versioning for prompts, resources, and capability files

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Capability YAML files have basic versioning (semver + MCP protocol version)
- ‚úÖ Content storage has rudimentary version fields in StorageMetadata
- ‚ùå MCP Resource/PromptTemplate types lack version fields
- ‚ùå No automatic version management or migration support

**Tasks**:

**Expected Impact**: Robust version management across all MagicTunnel content types with migration support

### 6. MCP 2025-06-18 User Consent System Implementation üîê **FUTURE - REQUIRES DESIGN CLARIFICATION**
**Status**: ‚ùå REMOVED (August 5, 2025) - All consent implementation removed due to design confusion

**Background**: 
- Previous consent implementation was unclear about when/why consent is needed
- Confusion between consent for data processing vs. consent for showing requests to users
- Consent blocking operations incorrectly instead of checking at data processing layer
- Complete removal performed to establish clean foundation for future implementation

**Design Questions to Resolve** (Before Implementation):
1. **Consent Purpose Clarification**:
   - Is consent for external data processing (sending data to OpenAI/Anthropic APIs)?
   - Or is consent for showing elicitation/sampling requests to users?
   - When exactly should consent be required vs. optional?

2. **Data Processing vs Request Consent**:
   - **Sampling Service**: Uses external LLM APIs - needs data processing consent for API calls
   - **Elicitation Service**: Local data collection only - unclear if consent needed
   - Should consent be checked at API call level, not at service operation level?

3. **User Experience Considerations**:
   - Can't users choose to respond or not respond to elicitation/sampling requests?
   - When is explicit consent UI necessary vs. implicit through user interaction?
   - How to balance security with usability?

**Future Implementation Requirements** (After Design Clarification):
- [ ] **Consent System Architecture Design**
  - [ ] Define clear consent scope (data processing vs. operation approval)
  - [ ] Design consent flow for external LLM service data transmission
  - [ ] Determine if elicitation operations require consent (no external APIs used)
  - [ ] Create consent level hierarchy (None/Basic/Explicit/Informed)

- [ ] **Data Processing Consent Implementation**
  - [ ] Add consent checks before external API calls (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
  - [ ] Implement consent UI for LLM data transmission approval
  - [ ] Create consent caching with appropriate TTL for user convenience
  - [ ] Add consent timeout handling and fallback behavior

- [ ] **Consent Configuration System**
  - [ ] Design consent presets (global_once, session_based, tool_based, operation_based)
  - [ ] Implement consent modes for external server interactions (proxy, supplement, override)
  - [ ] Add consent audit logging for compliance and debugging
  - [ ] Create consent policy management for different data sensitivity levels

- [ ] **User Interface Components**
  - [ ] Design consent request UI components
  - [ ] Create consent history and management interface
  - [ ] Implement consent preference settings
  - [ ] Add consent status indicators and controls

**Files Previously Removed** (August 5, 2025):
- `src/security/consent.rs` - Complete consent engine implementation
- Consent-related structs from `src/security/config.rs` (ConsentLevel, ConsentPreset, ConsentMode, etc.)
- Consent integration from `src/mcp/sampling.rs` and `src/mcp/elicitation.rs`
- ConsentRequired error codes from sampling and elicitation types

**Impact**: Clean foundation established - requires design clarification before re-implementation

### 7. MCP 2025-06-18 Security Configuration System üîê **FUTURE - DESIGN CLARIFICATION NEEDED**
**Status**: ‚ùå REMOVED (August 5, 2025) - All MCP 2025 security configuration removed due to no implementation

**Background**:
- Complex security configuration structures existed (`Mcp2025SecurityConfig`, `McpCapabilityPermissionsConfig`, etc.) but were never actually used
- OAuth implementation uses its own separate `ResourceIndicatorsConfig`, not `McpResourceIndicatorsConfig`
- No MCP services (sampling, elicitation, roots) reference or check these security configurations
- Configuration without implementation - same problem as consent system

**Removed Configuration Structures** (August 5, 2025):
- `Mcp2025SecurityConfig` - Main MCP security configuration container
- `McpCapabilityPermissionsConfig` - Permission controls for sampling/elicitation capabilities
- `McpToolApprovalConfig` - Tool execution approval workflows
- `McpOAuth21Config` - OAuth 2.1 enhancements (duplicated existing OAuth config)
- `McpResourceIndicatorsConfig` - Resource indicators (duplicated existing OAuth config)
- `PermissionBehavior` enum - Permission behavior types (Allow/Deny/Ask)
- `ApprovalNotificationMethod` enum - Approval notification methods

**Design Questions to Resolve** (Before Implementation):
1. **Security vs Configuration Duplication**:
   - OAuth already has complete Resource Indicators implementation - why duplicate?
   - Should MCP security extend existing OAuth/RBAC systems or replace them?
   - What specific MCP 2025-06-18 security features are actually required?

2. **Implementation vs Configuration**:
   - Is complex security configuration needed if no services use it?
   - Should security be enforced at middleware level vs. service level?
   - What's the right balance between configurability and simplicity?

3. **Actual MCP 2025-06-18 Requirements**:
   - Which parts of MCP 2025-06-18 spec actually require security configuration?
   - Are there specific compliance requirements that need implementation?
   - Can existing security systems (OAuth, RBAC, allowlisting) cover MCP requirements?

**Future Implementation Options** (After Design Clarification):
- **Option 1: Extend Existing Systems** - Enhance OAuth/RBAC to cover MCP requirements
- **Option 2: MCP-Specific Security Layer** - Build targeted MCP security without duplication
- **Option 3: Minimal Implementation** - Only implement actually required MCP security features

**Files Previously Removed** (August 5, 2025):
- MCP 2025 security structs from `src/security/config.rs` (~200 lines)
- MCP 2025 exports from `src/security/mod.rs`
- MCP 2025 references from `src/bin/magictunnel-security.rs`

**Impact**: Eliminated configuration bloat - requires actual requirements analysis before re-implementation

  - [x] Verified capability tracking works across stdio (Claude Desktop, Cursor)
  - [x] Verified capability tracking works across WebSocket connections
  - [x] Verified capability tracking works across HTTP connections

  - [x] Added smart discovery state tracking to enhancement pipeline
  - [x] Enhanced logic in `should_use_local_elicitation()` method
