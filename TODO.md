- ‚úÖ **External MCP Proxy** - External MCP servers can send sampling/elicitation requests through MagicTunnel
- ‚úÖ **Parameter Validation Elicitation** - Automatic elicitation on tool parameter validation failures

**Current Gaps - MagicTunnel-Initiated Requests**:

#### 5.1. LLM-Assisted Sampling Request Generation üß† **FUTURE ENHANCEMENT**
**Objective**: Enable MagicTunnel to automatically initiate sampling requests based on intelligent analysis

**Planned Triggers**:
- **Error-Based Triggers**: Tool execution failures that could benefit from LLM assistance
- **Parameter Ambiguity**: When parameter mapping fails or produces low confidence results  
- **Workflow Optimization**: During sequential tool execution chains that need guidance
- **Performance Enhancement**: For improving tool execution quality and results
- **Security Assistance**: Security-related scenarios requiring LLM guidance

**Implementation Approach**:
- [ ] **Rule-Based Triggers**: Pattern matching on error messages and execution context (no LLM calls)
- [ ] **Smart Discovery Integration**: Leverage existing confidence scores and enhancement data
- [ ] **Template-Based Request Generation**: Pre-written templates with variable substitution
- [ ] **Configuration-Driven**: Comprehensive trigger configuration system
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Prevent excessive LLM usage with intelligent throttling

### 6. Enhanced Versioning System üìã **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Status**: Currently has basic versioning, needs comprehensive version management

**Objective**: Implement robust versioning for prompts, resources, and capability files

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Capability YAML files have basic versioning (semver + MCP protocol version)

**Expected Impact**: Robust version management across all MagicTunnel content types with migration support

### 7. MCP 2025-06-18 User Consent System Implementation üîê **FUTURE - REQUIRES DESIGN CLARIFICATION**
**Status**: ‚ùå REMOVED (August 5, 2025) - All consent implementation removed due to design confusion

**Background**: 
- Previous consent implementation was unclear about when/why consent is needed
- Confusion between consent for data processing vs. consent for showing requests to users
- Consent blocking operations incorrectly instead of checking at data processing layer
- Complete removal performed to establish clean foundation for future implementation

**Design Questions to Resolve** (Before Implementation):
1. **Consent Purpose Clarification**:
   - Is consent for external data processing (sending data to OpenAI/Anthropic APIs)?
   - Or is consent for showing elicitation/sampling requests to users?
   - When exactly should consent be required vs. optional?

2. **Data Processing vs Request Consent**:
   - **Sampling Service**: Uses external LLM APIs - needs data processing consent for API calls
   - **Elicitation Service**: Local data collection only - unclear if consent needed
   - Should consent be checked at API call level, not at service operation level?

3. **User Experience Considerations**:
   - Can't users choose to respond or not respond to elicitation/sampling requests?
   - When is explicit consent UI necessary vs. implicit through user interaction?
   - How to balance security with usability?

**Future Implementation Requirements** (After Design Clarification):
- [ ] **Consent System Architecture Design**
  - [ ] Define clear consent scope (data processing vs. operation approval)
  - [ ] Design consent flow for external LLM service data transmission
  - [ ] Determine if elicitation operations require consent (no external APIs used)
  - [ ] Create consent level hierarchy (None/Basic/Explicit/Informed)

- [ ] **Data Processing Consent Implementation**
  - [ ] Add consent checks before external API calls (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
  - [ ] Implement consent UI for LLM data transmission approval
  - [ ] Create consent caching with appropriate TTL for user convenience
  - [ ] Add consent timeout handling and fallback behavior

- [ ] **Consent Configuration System**
  - [ ] Design consent presets (global_once, session_based, tool_based, operation_based)
  - [ ] Implement consent modes for external server interactions (proxy, supplement, override)
  - [ ] Add consent audit logging for compliance and debugging
  - [ ] Create consent policy management for different data sensitivity levels

- [ ] **User Interface Components**
  - [ ] Design consent request UI components
  - [ ] Create consent history and management interface
  - [ ] Implement consent preference settings
  - [ ] Add consent status indicators and controls

**Files Previously Removed** (August 5, 2025):
- `src/security/consent.rs` - Complete consent engine implementation
- Consent-related structs from `src/security/config.rs` (ConsentLevel, ConsentPreset, ConsentMode, etc.)
- Consent integration from `src/mcp/sampling.rs` and `src/mcp/elicitation.rs`
- ConsentRequired error codes from sampling and elicitation types

**Impact**: Clean foundation established - requires design clarification before re-implementation

### 8. MCP 2025-06-18 Security Configuration System üîê **FUTURE - DESIGN CLARIFICATION NEEDED**
**Status**: ‚ùå REMOVED (August 5, 2025) - All MCP 2025 security configuration removed due to no implementation

**Background**:
- Complex security configuration structures existed (`Mcp2025SecurityConfig`, `McpCapabilityPermissionsConfig`, etc.) but were never actually used
- OAuth implementation uses its own separate `ResourceIndicatorsConfig`, not `McpResourceIndicatorsConfig`
- No MCP services (sampling, elicitation, roots) reference or check these security configurations
- Configuration without implementation - same problem as consent system

**Removed Configuration Structures** (August 5, 2025):
- `Mcp2025SecurityConfig` - Main MCP security configuration container
- `McpCapabilityPermissionsConfig` - Permission controls for sampling/elicitation capabilities
- `McpToolApprovalConfig` - Tool execution approval workflows
- `McpOAuth21Config` - OAuth 2.1 enhancements (duplicated existing OAuth config)
- `McpResourceIndicatorsConfig` - Resource indicators (duplicated existing OAuth config)
- `PermissionBehavior` enum - Permission behavior types (Allow/Deny/Ask)
- `ApprovalNotificationMethod` enum - Approval notification methods

**Design Questions to Resolve** (Before Implementation):
1. **Security vs Configuration Duplication**:
   - OAuth already has complete Resource Indicators implementation - why duplicate?
   - Should MCP security extend existing OAuth/RBAC systems or replace them?
   - What specific MCP 2025-06-18 security features are actually required?

2. **Implementation vs Configuration**:
   - Is complex security configuration needed if no services use it?
   - Should security be enforced at middleware level vs. service level?
   - What's the right balance between configurability and simplicity?

3. **Actual MCP 2025-06-18 Requirements**:
   - Which parts of MCP 2025-06-18 spec actually require security configuration?
   - Are there specific compliance requirements that need implementation?
   - Can existing security systems (OAuth, RBAC, allowlisting) cover MCP requirements?

**Future Implementation Options** (After Design Clarification):
- **Option 1: Extend Existing Systems** - Enhance OAuth/RBAC to cover MCP requirements
- **Option 2: MCP-Specific Security Layer** - Build targeted MCP security without duplication
- **Option 3: Minimal Implementation** - Only implement actually required MCP security features

**Files Previously Removed** (August 5, 2025):
- MCP 2025 security structs from `src/security/config.rs` (~200 lines)
- MCP 2025 exports from `src/security/mod.rs`
- MCP 2025 references from `src/bin/magictunnel-security.rs`

**Impact**: Eliminated configuration bloat - requires actual requirements analysis before re-implementation



### 9. Development Tools Integration üõ†Ô∏è **NEW - HIGH VALUE**

### 6.1 MCP Tool Invocation Hijacking Prevention üö® **CRITICAL - INSPIRED BY MOBILE SECURITY EVOLUTION**
**Status**: Architectural vulnerability identified - requires specification-level changes
**Priority**: **URGENT** - MCP will face the same security pitfalls as early mobile URI schemes

**Background**: MCP's current global tool registry with name-based routing creates identical vulnerabilities to early mobile deep links before Android App Links/iOS Universal Links were introduced. Without cryptographic verification of tool ownership, the system is vulnerable to namespace hijacking attacks.

**Current Vulnerabilities**:
- **Tool Name Squatting**: Malicious tools can register popular tool names first
- **Typo-Squatting**: Tools with names similar to legitimate ones (e.g., `file_read` vs `file-read`)
- **Zero Authority Verification**: No way to verify a tool's authenticity or rightful ownership of a namespace
- **Global Namespace Collision**: Multiple tools can claim the same name with no resolution mechanism

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] **Tool Authority Verification System** (`src/security/tool_authority.rs`)
  - [ ] Design `ToolAuthorityValidator` struct with cryptographic namespace verification
  - [ ] Implement tool signature validation using digital certificates
  - [ ] Add namespace ownership proof system (similar to domain ownership verification)
  - [ ] Create tool authenticity chain validation
  - [ ] Add trusted tool registry integration
  - [ ] Implement certificate revocation checking

- [ ] **Enhanced Tool Registry** (`src/registry/authority_registry.rs`)
  - [ ] Extend tool registration to require authority proofs
  - [ ] Add namespace reservation system with ownership verification
  - [ ] Implement tool signature validation during registration
  - [ ] Create conflict resolution mechanism for namespace disputes
  - [ ] Add trusted authority certificate management
  - [ ] Implement tool identity verification workflows

- [ ] **Namespace Security Framework**
  - [ ] Design hierarchical namespace system (e.g., `com.company.tool_name`)
  - [ ] Implement namespace delegation and sub-authority verification
  - [ ] Add certificate chain validation for nested namespaces
  - [ ] Create namespace ownership transfer mechanisms
  - [ ] Implement namespace expiration and renewal policies

- [ ] **Integration with Existing Security**
  - [ ] Extend allowlisting system to include authority verification
  - [ ] Update RBAC to consider tool authority in permission decisions
  - [ ] Add audit logging for all authority verification attempts
  - [ ] Integrate with emergency lockdown system for authority failures

**Expected Timeline**: 2-3 months after MCP specification updates
**Dependencies**: Requires MCP Working Group specification changes

### 6.2 MCP Resource URI Hijacking Prevention üîí **CRITICAL - DOMAIN AUTHORITY VERIFICATION**
**Status**: Resource addressing vulnerability requires domain-style verification system

**Current Vulnerabilities**:
- **Resource URI Spoofing**: Malicious servers can claim legitimate resource URIs
- **No Domain Verification**: Resources lack equivalent of TLS certificate validation
- **Authority Ambiguity**: Multiple servers can serve the same resource URI with different content
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: No cryptographic binding between resource URI and authoritative server

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] **Resource Authority Verification** (`src/security/resource_authority.rs`)
  - [ ] Design `ResourceAuthorityValidator` for domain-style verification
  - [ ] Implement resource URI certificate validation (similar to TLS)
  - [ ] Add domain ownership proof for resource namespaces
  - [ ] Create resource integrity verification using cryptographic hashes
  - [ ] Implement resource authority certificate chain validation

- [ ] **Resource Domain Management**
  - [ ] Design resource domain namespace system
  - [ ] Add domain delegation for resource hierarchies
  - [ ] Implement resource domain certificate issuance and validation
  - [ ] Create resource authority trust stores and certificate management
  - [ ] Add domain ownership transfer and revocation mechanisms

- [ ] **Secure Resource Resolution**
  - [ ] Implement secure resource lookup with authority verification
  - [ ] Add resource caching with integrity validation
  - [ ] Create resource proxy with authority enforcement
  - [ ] Implement resource mirroring with authenticity preservation
  - [ ] Add resource version integrity and rollback protection

**Expected Timeline**: 2-3 months (can parallel with tool authority work)

### 6.3 MCP Authority Infrastructure üèõÔ∏è **FOUNDATION ARCHITECTURE**
**Status**: Requires new infrastructure for authority verification and certificate management

**Infrastructure Requirements**:
- [ ] **Certificate Authority (CA) System**
  - [ ] Design MCP-specific certificate authority infrastructure
  - [ ] Implement certificate issuance for tool and resource namespaces
  - [ ] Add certificate revocation list (CRL) management
  - [ ] Create certificate lifecycle management (issuance, renewal, revocation)
  - [ ] Implement root certificate distribution and trust establishment

- [ ] **Trust Store Management**
  - [ ] Design trusted authority registry for certificate validation
  - [ ] Implement root certificate installation and updates
  - [ ] Add certificate pinning for critical namespaces
  - [ ] Create trust policy configuration and management
  - [ ] Implement certificate transparency logging for audit

- [ ] **Authority Verification Service**
  - [ ] Create centralized authority verification service
  - [ ] Implement real-time certificate validation with OCSP
  - [ ] Add authority caching with appropriate TTL
  - [ ] Create authority verification API for MCP clients
  - [ ] Implement authority verification middleware for tool/resource requests

### 6.4 Backward Compatibility & Migration üîÑ **TRANSITION STRATEGY**
**Status**: Plan for gradual migration from current insecure system to verified authority system

**Migration Strategy**:
- [ ] **Phased Implementation**
  - [ ] Phase 1: Authority verification as optional enhancement (no breaking changes)
  - [ ] Phase 2: Authority warnings for unverified tools/resources
  - [ ] Phase 3: Authority verification required for new registrations
  - [ ] Phase 4: Full authority verification enforcement

- [ ] **Legacy Support**
  - [ ] Maintain compatibility with existing tools during transition
  - [ ] Implement authority upgrade paths for existing tools
  - [ ] Add legacy tool authority grandfathering policies
  - [ ] Create migration assistance tools for tool developers

- [ ] **Configuration Framework**
  - [ ] Add authority verification configuration levels (off, warn, enforce)
  - [ ] Implement per-namespace authority policies
  - [ ] Create authority verification exemption lists for trusted tools
  - [ ] Add authority enforcement timing configuration

### 6.5 Standards & Specification Work üìã **EXTERNAL COLLABORATION**
**Status**: Requires collaboration with MCP Working Group and broader community

**Specification Tasks**:
- [ ] **MCP Specification Contributions**
  - [ ] Draft MCP authority verification specification extension
  - [ ] Propose tool namespace authority verification protocol
  - [ ] Design resource URI authority verification specification
  - [ ] Submit authority verification RFCs to MCP working group

- [ ] **Industry Standards Integration**
  - [ ] Align with existing PKI standards and best practices
  - [ ] Integrate with web PKI for resource URI verification
  - [ ] Adopt proven security patterns from mobile app linking
  - [ ] Collaborate with security community on threat model validation

- [ ] **Community Engagement**
  - [ ] Present security findings to MCP community
  - [ ] Gather feedback from MCP client and server developers
  - [ ] Create security best practices documentation
  - [ ] Establish security working group within MCP community

**Expected Impact**: 
- **Short Term (6-12 months)**: Prevent tool/resource hijacking attacks as MCP adoption grows
- **Long Term (1-2+ years)**: Establish MCP as secure, enterprise-ready protocol with verified authority
- **Industry Impact**: Help MCP avoid repeating mobile security evolution mistakes

**Priority Justification**: This represents a fundamental architectural security flaw that will become more critical as MCP adoption grows. Early implementation prevents the need for disruptive security fixes later, similar to how mobile platforms had to retrofit security after widespread adoption.

  - [ ] `local.rs` - Initial implementation (username/password)
  - [ ] Ready for `clerk.rs`, `auth0.rs`, `oidc.rs` additions later
- [ ] **Create admin authentication APIs** (`src/web/auth_api.rs`)
  - [ ] `GET /api/auth/current-user` - Get current system administrator
  - [ ] `POST /api/auth/login` - Admin login with username/password
  - [ ] `POST /api/auth/logout` - Admin logout
  - [ ] `POST /api/auth/create-user` - Create new admin user (admin-only)
  - [ ] `GET /api/auth/users` - List admin users
- [ ] **Admin user types**: system-admin, tool-manager, security-auditor, read-only-viewer

### **7.2 Notification System APIs**
- [ ] **Create notification management** (`src/web/notifications_api.rs`)
  - [ ] `GET /api/notifications` - List user notifications
  - [ ] `POST /api/notifications/{id}/read` - Mark notification as read
  - [ ] `POST /api/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all as read
- [ ] **Add notification storage** (in-memory or database)
- [ ] **Integrate with security events** (audit logs, security alerts)

### **7.3 MCP Client Permission Management APIs**
- [ ] **Extend security API** (`src/web/security_api.rs`) with MCP client management:
  - [ ] `GET /api/security/mcp-clients` - List MCP clients (agents/applications) 
  - [ ] `POST /api/security/mcp-clients` - Register new MCP client
  - [ ] `GET /api/security/mcp-clients/{id}/permissions` - Get client tool permissions
  - [ ] `PUT /api/security/mcp-clients/{id}/permissions` - Update client permissions
  - [ ] `GET /api/security/client-roles` - List available client role templates
  - [ ] `GET /api/security/statistics` - MCP client access statistics
- [ ] **Add MCP client data structures**: ClientProfile, ToolPermissions, AccessRules

### **7.4 Dynamic Navigation API**
- [ ] **Create navigation endpoints** (`src/web/navigation_api.rs`)
  - [ ] `GET /api/navigation/items` - Get available navigation based on admin permissions  
  - [ ] `GET /api/search/items` - Get searchable items for current system admin

### **7.5 Frontend API Integration**
- [ ] **Authentication Integration**
  - [ ] Create auth API client (`frontend/src/lib/api/auth.ts`)
  - [ ] Add authentication store (`frontend/src/lib/stores/auth.ts`)
  - [ ] Replace hardcoded currentUser in TopBar with real auth data
  - [ ] Add login/logout functionality

- [ ] **Notification System Integration**
  - [ ] Create notifications API client (`frontend/src/lib/api/notifications.ts`)
  - [ ] Add notification store (`frontend/src/lib/stores/notifications.ts`) 
  - [ ] Replace hardcoded notifications array in TopBar
  - [ ] Add real-time notification updates (polling or WebSocket)

- [ ] **MCP Client Management Components Fix**
  - [ ] Update RBAC components to manage MCP clients instead of system users
  - [ ] Replace "Users" with "MCP Clients" - agents/applications connecting via MCP
  - [ ] Replace "Roles" with "Client Access Templates" - predefined permission sets
  - [ ] Remove mock data generation from security pages
  - [ ] Add proper error handling for missing endpoints

- [ ] **Dynamic Navigation**
  - [ ] Replace hardcoded searchableItems with API-driven data
  - [ ] Add permission-based navigation filtering

### **7.6 MCP Tool Authentication Strategy**

#### **Different MCP Types & Auth Approaches**

**1. External MCP Servers** (e.g., filesystem, custom servers)
- **Auth**: Handled by external server itself - MagicTunnel proxies requests as-is
- **Example**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` manages its own file permissions
- **MagicTunnel Role**: Pure proxy - no authentication injection

**2. Imported API Tools** (converted from OpenAPI/REST)
- **Auth Challenge**: Need to inject API keys, OAuth tokens into requests
- **Examples**: Google Sheets, HTTP client tools, third-party APIs
- **Solution**: System admin configures credentials via Web UI, MagicTunnel injects them

**3. Built-in/Local Tools** (system monitoring, utilities)
- **Auth**: RBAC controls which MCP clients can access which tools
- **Solution**: Permission matrix managed by system admins

#### **Implementation Components**
- [ ] **Credential Store** (`src/auth/credentials.rs`) - Encrypted storage for API keys/tokens
- [ ] **MCP Client Registry** (`src/auth/mcp_clients.rs`) - Track client permissions
- [ ] **Auth Injection Middleware** (`src/routing/auth_middleware.rs`) - Inject credentials into tool calls

### **7.7 Mock/Stub Data Inventory & Status**

#### **TopBar Component** (/frontend/src/lib/components/layout/TopBar.svelte)
- [ ] **Notifications array** (lines 28-56): 3 hardcoded security/system notifications with fixed timestamps
- [ ] **Current user object** (lines 67-73): "John Doe" with hardcoded name, email, role, avatar, permissions  
- [ ] **Searchable items array** (lines 76-85): Static navigation items for security/admin pages

#### **Security Components** (Enterprise UI - Missing Backend)
- [ ] **Audit System**: All audit APIs call real endpoints but many are unimplemented
- [ ] **Content Sanitization**: All UI calls real APIs but backend incomplete
- [ ] **RBAC User Management**: Missing user/role/permission endpoints

#### **Already Fixed** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **TopBar system metrics**: Successfully replaced with real API calls to system metrics endpoint
- ‚úÖ **Connection tracking**: Real MCP session data now displayed instead of hardcoded values
- ‚úÖ **Process-specific metrics**: Added real-time monitoring of MagicTunnel and supervisor processes
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced system monitoring**: System metrics now include both system totals and service-specific resource usage

### **7.8 Architecture Clarifications**

#### **Dual-Layer Authentication System**:

**Layer 1: System Administration (Web UI)**
- **Purpose**: Human administrators managing MagicTunnel system
- **Authentication**: Traditional web login (username/password, SSO)
- **Users**: system-admin, tool-manager, security-auditor, read-only-viewer

**Layer 2: MCP Client Management (Protocol-level)**
- **Purpose**: LLM agents/applications connecting via MCP protocol
- **Authentication**: API keys, client certificates (delegated to underlying tools/servers)
- **RBAC Target**: Current RBAC UI mockup manages MCP client permissions, not admin users

#### **Implementation Focus - SIMPLIFIED START**
- **Simple Username/Password Auth**: Start with default admin:admin login
- **Local User Management**: System admin can create additional admin users via Web UI
- **Modular Architecture**: Built for future expansion to Clerk, Auth0, etc.
- **MCP Client RBAC**: System admins control which MCP clients access which tools
- **Credential Injection**: For imported API tools requiring authentication
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add enterprise features later

### **7.9 Implementation Timeline**

#### **Week 1: Core Backend APIs - SIMPLIFIED START**
1. **Simple Authentication System** - Username/password with default admin:admin
2. **Admin User Management** - Create/list admin users via Web UI
3. **Notification API** - Basic notification CRUD
4. **MCP Client Management APIs** - Client registration, permissions, statistics

#### **Week 2: Frontend Integration**  
1. **Admin auth integration** - Replace hardcoded system admin data
2. **Notification integration** - Replace hardcoded notifications  
3. **MCP Client Management fixes** - Remove all mock data generation from RBAC components

#### **Week 3: Polish & Enhancement**
1. **Dynamic navigation** - Permission-based search/navigation
2. **Real-time updates** - WebSocket or polling
3. **Error handling** - Graceful degradation when APIs unavailable

**Expected Impact**: Transform frontend from demo/mock interface to fully functional production system with real backend integration
