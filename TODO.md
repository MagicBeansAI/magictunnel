  - [ ] Git hooks for version management

**Integration Patterns**:
```bash
# Proposed make targets
make validate          # Run YAML validation
make migrate           # Migrate legacy files  
make test-semantic     # Run semantic search tests
make release VERSION=  # Full release workflow
```

**Impact**: Transform standalone scripts into integrated development workflow tools
