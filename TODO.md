- **After**: 0 dead functions - **100% elimination achieved**
- **Result**: Clean codebase with zero function-level dead code warnings

### **Function Integration Matrix**
| Function | Action | Integration Point | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------------------|---------|
| `validate_operation_type_references` | ✅ **INTEGRATED** | Comprehensive validation line 1098 | Validates operation types exist in schema |
| `validate_argument_types` | ✅ **INTEGRATED** | Comprehensive validation line 1101 | Validates argument types and default values |
| `build_type_dependency_graph` | ✅ **INTEGRATED** | Comprehensive validation line 1104 | Builds type dependency graph for analysis |
| `extract_defined_types` | ✅ **USED** | Called by operation validation | Extracts all defined types from schema |
| `validate_default_value_type` | ✅ **USED** | Called by argument validation | Validates default values match types |
| `extract_field_types_from_type_definition` | ✅ **USED** | Called by dependency graph | Extracts field types from definitions |
| `load_capability_file` | ✅ **MADE PUBLIC** | Registry service API | Public API for loading capability files |
| `detect_circular_references` | ❌ **REMOVED** | N/A | Unnecessary (circular refs allowed in GraphQL) |
| `has_circular_dependency` | ❌ **REMOVED** | N/A | Related to circular reference detection |
| `parse_operation_from_sdl_line` | ❌ **REMOVED** | N/A | Redundant alternative parsing method |

### **Critical Bug Fixes**
- **Fixed**: `extract_base_type_name` now handles nested lists correctly
  - **Before**: `[[String]]` → `[String]` (incorrect)
  - **After**: `[[String]]` → `String` (correct)
- **Enhanced**: Comprehensive validation now includes operation-level checks
- **Improved**: Schema validation catches more errors early in pipeline

### **Quality Metrics**
- ✅ **All 71 GraphQL tests passing** (including previously failing tests)
- ✅ **Zero dead function warnings** (down from 10)
- ✅ **Enhanced validation coverage** with operation type checking
- ✅ **Cleaner codebase** with 82 lines of dead code removed
- ✅ **Better API design** with public registry functions
